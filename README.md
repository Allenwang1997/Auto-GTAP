## Abstract ##
In principle, a GTAP simulation can be run with a single DOS command, but in reality, the process ends up being much more compicated.
This is because a typical GTAP-based research project includes not just the simulation, but building the simulation’s database, 
calculating shocks, moving files between each step, and finally exporting results.
While the simulation itself is automated, these other steps are typically done manually by the user.
Auto-GTAP provides a unified framework for automating these tasks, 
increasing the speed at which GTAP models can be revised and reducing the chance of user error.

## Why use Auto-GTAP? ##
The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model was developed in [citation] and 
has frequently been used since to estimate the effect of government policies on international trade.
However, the biggest advantage of the GTAP model is not the original model itself, but the ecosystem around it. 
The canonical version introduced in [citation] has been updated to version 7 in [citation] 
and contributors have developed other versions of it focusing on topics such as 
energy [citation], biofuels [citation], and electricity [citation].
Developers have also created a number of other software tools for dealing with the anciliary issues that crop up in these research projects,
especially with databases.
There are tools automating the process of data aggregation (GTAPAG2), disaggregation (SplitCom), revision (GTAPAdjust and AlterTax). 
The existence of these tools makes it easy for developers to customize the model for their specific project, 
as they do not have to reinvent the wheel.

However, some parts of a GTAP-based research have not been automated. 
In particular, there is no overarching framework controlling both the model and all these tools: 
the process of running the tools, specifiying their settings, and moving the output to the input of other tools must all be done manually.

Until now. Auto-GTAP provides a unified framework for running all parts of a GTAP-based research project.

## Components of Auto-GTAP ##
Files and folders in Auto-GTAP are organized into several groups based on their function. 
These groups are InputFiles, WorkFiles, OutputFiles, Python files, and Configuration files.

The “InputFiles” folder and its subfolders contain the external inputs into the model. 
The raw data or code is taken directly from other sources with no modification whatsoever. 
This folder includes GTAP models, data, and external programs (like SplitCom). 
Currently, several standard models are included but the intent is for researchers to add new subfolders containing the data and models they are using for their project. 
For example, if a developer is using GTAP-BIO to look at sugarcane trade, the might add an additional subfolder for GTAP-BIO and one for sugarcane data. 
Note that the disaggregated GTAP database is not included here in the public version of the program, as that data is licensed. 
However, it is recommended that researchers with access to that database include it in their version.

The “OutputFiles” folder contains the final results of various simulations run by Auto-GTAP. This folder does not contain all results generation by the simulation. 
As part of the Auto-GTAP configuration file, researchers can configure which results they wish to export, and only those results are exported.

The “WorkFiles” folder contains temporary files used by Auto-GTAP as it is in the process of running the different parts of a GTAP project. 
It contains all files generated by the various programs and simulations run by Auto-GTAP and thus will have all results of the most recently run Auto-GTAP run (OutputFiles only has a subset of these results). 
All contents of this folder are deleted at the beginning of each Auto-GTAP run.

The python files preform the actual work of Auto-GTAP: moving files between folders, editing files, and executing programs. 
The python files are grouped into a number of different modules based on their purpose. The primary python file is “Main” and it calls all the other modules. 
These other modules all relate to a particular task in Auto-GTAP: deleting temporary files, moving files from InputFiles to WorkFiles, generating GEMSIM programs, running simulations, etc.

The final component of Auto-GTAP is the configuration file. 
This file gives the specifics to the Python files about which steps to run, in which order, with which models and data, etc. 
The intent is to keep the Python files generic and put details relevant to particular model applications in the configuration file.
