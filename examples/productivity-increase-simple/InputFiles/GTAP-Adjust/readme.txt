This archive contains GTAPAdjust, a program to adjust flows in (or
remove imbalances from) a standard GTAP database. Requires GEMPACK.

The package is supplied as a ZIP archive -- unzip this into an empty
new folder with a short and simple name (such as C:\GTAPAdjust).

Then read document Adjust.PDF (or ADjust.doc).
