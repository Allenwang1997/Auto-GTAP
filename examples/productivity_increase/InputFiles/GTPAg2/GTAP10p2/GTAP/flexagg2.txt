 ! 5. AGGREGATED ENDOWMENTS 
 !  
 !   In this section, the default endowment aggregation for GTAP
 !   version 5 has been specified. Users may change the aggregation 
 !   following these rules: 
 !       a) Additional lines may be added as needed and unused lines
 !          should be removed.  
 !       b) If the aggregated database is to be used with the GTAP  
 !          model, one of the aggregated endowment names should be  
 !          "capital", since this plays a key role in the model.
 !       c) Specify the classification of the aggregated factor,
 !          whether sluggish or mobile. There should be at least one
 !          sluggish and at least one mobile factor.
 !       d) Specify a value for the elasticity of transformation,   
 !          "ETRAE".  A number must be given for all endowments,
 !          mobile or sluggish, though its value matters only for   
 !          the sluggish endowments.
